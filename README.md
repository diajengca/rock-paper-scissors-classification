# rock-paper-scissors-classification
This is image classification project that is based on online course provided by Dicoding.

The goal of the project is to create an image classifier that can predict if an uploaded image is an image of rock, paper, or scissors. To classfiy the image, I use Tensorflow to do image augmentation and image data generator. Then, I use Keras Tensorflow to create a classifier model using Convolutional Neural Network algorithm.
